# Transparent Foods

## Legend
Buyer
Seller
Unions, where they buy/sell in bulk/provide teams/knowledge, repackage and distribute in private channels if needed. (Private, union-protected information, only members of the Union can view).

## Entry point 1.
The entry point is the Buyer.

### Story 1.
He clicks button to buy his special VIP package of fresh fruits delivered to his home daily.

Why he buys the product? Because he believes it's good for his and his family's health/he wants to support the idea/we offered special package/because our fruits have appealing package (with qr code with nutrients and a website link to check the conditions of soil, temperature of air, etc of a Seller. Q01: how do we check the condition of soil, air temperature of a Seller?).

How does he know about the platform? We contacted him (in which case he doesn't even need to click) /friends/social accounts/influencers (in good food/health/yoga segment).

Where do we get the product from? We have 
  unharvested crop
    team goes in to harvest, analyze (Q02: how?), package, deliver all in a span of hours.
      how does a team gets a notification for the job?
        platform.
      where do we get the team from?
        special training/interested Unions
      how does a platform play into this?
        dispatching team
          team info, facebook like profile (Do we need it?)
        being a media for parties
          social platform, messages, holding a trust token
        propagating a click event
          storing a buy event with x buyer (x info, facebook-like) and y seller (y info, facebook-like), z amount of buying fee (blockchain cooin/internal coin/us dollars/local currency/ bank cards);
          showing a buyer and seller movements of the product (tracking system)
        money trustee between parties (in the name we trust)
        quality assurance x100 (government backed, scientific facilities backed)
    alternatives?
      pick up by Buyer from POD (point of distribution) facility (cofee, food available?)
  packaged product in our facility
    dispatching products to end user
      how?
        need to solve distribution logic
          free shipment?
          vip shipment vs slow shipment?
          POS? point of sale/distribution
    quality controls, temperature, documented
    some of the [unharvested crop] points

When do we dispatch the product?
  depends on the needs of the end user,
    allow for scheduling, cyclical deliveries
  depends on the lifecycle of a product,
    storing in our facilities vs getting it to the end user ASAP
    allowing for storage in top quality environment, for fee (target: restaurants, small businesses)

How do we get money from X to Y, subtracting fees
  The fee is taken from the original payment. Held onto it in the system. Released after the buyer receives the product/delivery manager acknowledges the delivery.
  Blockchain?

    ? creating payment system
    ? need blockchain expert (call Roma)
    ? why the blockchain anyway ???

### Story 2.



## Entry point 2.
The entry point is the Seller. 

### Story 1.
He clicks button to call our manager to consult on his farm.
  The meeting is scheduled
    On the meeting, the product and the environment is evaluated
    Next meeting, there has to be an offer to the seller
    Next, the product is ours, the Seller got the payment already
    Otherwise, we take it for distribution and see what we can do.
  He decides to set everything up by himself
    Creates a pipeline by himself
      organizes distribution from the system (Distribution Union)
      contacts buyers
      organizes quality control with our products (app and metric devices)


## Use case in Cambodia
Potential for having investment
Potential for having good quality products for cheap price for our distribution and test of the system.
Creating a small self-sustaining module, growing it farm by farm. All digitalized. Every notification and event is stored in the system.
Grab-like interface and platform-minded orientation. 

## Use case in Singapore
System refinement, integration in a big, competitive market.
Getting help from the government.

## Use case in China
Total integration of a system in the market.


## Traceability 101 Video notes
IFT - food protocolling

### Why traceability
Use Cases
  food safety, recall management
  sustainability
  fraud
  legality

### The Problem

1up1down -> E2E transition
1up1down
  scalability problem
  parts work independently
  no process improvement propagation to the system
  small parties big parties (inequality)
  in need of digitalization
          of efficient protocol
          of distributed system, easily-accessible anywhere in the world

Virus example of traceability importance
  South Korean people beat the virus faster than anyone because they traced people.
  Imagine we have the system where we can trace food diceases.
